        <p>Global Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are upgrading their networks in urban and dense urban environments to
            enable faster service and meet the growing digital demands of the future. To do so, they must ensure high
            quality of service (QoS) and a consistent end-user experience everywhere and at any time, especially during
            peak usage hours.</p>
        <div class="heading">
            <h2>Expand and Modernize Your Networks</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Our Urban Solution allows MNOs to expand and modernize their networks with an urban-ready, ALL G, Open RAN
            solution which is O-RAN Alliance compliant running on 7.2 radios. Our solution is easy to install,
            high-performing and reduces Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) while simplifying maintenance and enabling a broad
            ecosystem of partners.</p>
        <img src="../assets/Solutions/capacity-img.jpg" alt="">
        <p>With commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) vBBU hardware our Urban Solution enables Open RAN radios, resource
            orchestration, network slicing and subscriber management across All Gs – 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G and beyond. Our
            solution has advanced through the 3GPP and O-RAN Alliance release roadmap and is supporting the foundational
            features and capabilities for strong network performance in high-capacity urban environments.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="features">
        <h2>Features and Capabilities</h2>
        <p>Our Urban Solution is an agile, software-based approach to RAN infrastructure, which is designed to allow
            MNOs to quickly deploy network upgrades at a lower TCO. The following describes the features and benefits of
            our state-of-the-art Urban Solution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Innovate - Proprietary interfaces and limited flexibility with legacy suppliers make it challenging for
                MNOs to maintain, expand, and upgrade their networks to meet future demands. With our Parallel Wireless
                Urban solution, MNOs can avoid vendor lock-in, scale and enable new innovative services seamlessly with
                cloud-native centralized tools such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), DevOps,
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).</li>
            <li>
                Futureproof for 5G - MNOs need to upgrade their networks to prepare for the explosive data demands such
                as Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, autonomous driving, and digital health. With our Urban
                solution MNOs can upgrade their networks to any G with a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) vBBU which is
                easy to install, has open interfaces and supports a broad ecosystem of vendors across 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G,
                preparing networks for the future. <br>
                Easy to install, modernize and expand networks - The costs to deploy and maintain networks and the lack
                of interoperability can be daunting as many operators are supporting 2G voice while migrating to 4G data
                and preparing for the greater bandwidth possibilities of 5G. Easily change and upgrade technologies to
                support emerging needs with our cloud-native software-based solution.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) - Network Operations Center (NOC), zoning and permits, management
                services, power and backhaul, are a few of the many expenses required to maintain and upgrade networks.
                A cloud-native, software-defined architecture with state-of-the art features such as RAN automation,
                self-configuration, hands free software testing, integration and delivery drives down costs and improves
                interoperability. A container based DU/CU implementation across ALL Gs, enables faster time-to-market
                for new services and features enabling OPEX and CAPEX savings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enhance end user experience - MNOs need to deliver a high quality and consistent experience everywhere,
                and all times, including during peak usage hours in high-capacity urban environments. Artificial
                Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) enable seamless software upgrades utilizing data to optimize
                network performance in urban environments, delivering optimal subscriber throughput and quality of
                service. With open non-proprietary interfaces, the Parallel Wireless Urban Solution addresses network
                overloads during high peak hours, ensuring ubiquitous coverage, enabling state-of-the-art applications
                such as IoT, and exceeding customer expectations.

        </ul>

        <h2>Deployment Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
            Mobile Network Operators must have flexibility with network deployments while simultaneously keeping Capital
            Expenses (CAPEX) and Operating Expenses (OPEX) down, which is extremely important in high-capacity, dense
            urban environments. Our Urban Solution is ALL G, O-RAN compliant and enables cost conscious mobile operators
            to overcome deployment barriers while meeting necessary targets of generating new revenue, improving end
            user experience, reducing TCO and making their networks future-proof.
        </p>
        <p>
            With our lean Open RAN cloud-native software solution on a modest server and Open RAN automation with DevOps
            and CI/CD, network upgrades and software updates are easier and faster to roll out, thus improving TCO.
            Multi-vendor and multi-operator support allows flexible deployments even in the most difficult urban
            locations.
        </p>

            and Rural, and enables ALL Gs from the same base station and is software upgradeable to 5G. This option
            includes pooled server capacity with a COTS vBBU and is upgradeable to accommodate other splits. Parallel
            Wireless has successfully worked with Inland Cellular, and Vodafone Turkey and Ireland implementing Urban,
            Suburban and Rural deployments.</p>
        <p>Our Urban Solution is the first O-RAN Alliance compliant Open RAN solution supporting all generations of
            networks, from 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G on 7.2 radios. With open, non-proprietary interfaces that address network
            overloads during high peak hours, ensuring ubiquitous coverage, faster speeds, and lower latency, the Urban
            Solution enables digital transformations preparing networks for the future.</p>
