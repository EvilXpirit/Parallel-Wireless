        <p>Effective Date: April 20, 2023</p>
        <p>
            In this Website Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”), we, Parallel Wireless, Inc. (“Parallel”) provide
            information about how we collect, use, store, and transfer personally identifiable information sent to us by
            you through our websites and our careers application portal hosted and managed by a third party that shares
            your data with us, which may be found at https://www.parallelwireless.com/careers/ (collectively “the
            Site”). Our Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use, accessible here
            (https://www.parallelwireless.com/privacy-policy/#terms).</p>
        <p><strong>1. Scope</strong></p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to data collected through the Site and not any other data collection or
            processing including, without limitation, data we may collect offline or data collection practices of other
            web pages to which we link, or through websites, products or services that do not display a direct link to
            this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to data collected through the Site and not any other data collection or
            processing including, without limitation, data we may collect offline or data collection practices of other
            web pages to which we link, or through websites, products or services that do not display a direct link to
            this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Types of Data and Collection Methods</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Data you submit.</strong> When you request information, subscribe to or order a product or service,
            register as a user, respond to an online survey, submit an application for employment, or otherwise actively
            send us data, we usually collect data such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number,
            and certain information related to you or the business you represent. In connection with chargeable
            services, we will also collect payment information, phone number, and billing and shipping addresses. In
            connection with applications for employment, the Site will also prompt you to provide employment and
            educational history, phone number, and other contact information. We sometimes partner with other
            organizations. When we do, we may present you with the option to share your email and personal information
            with the partner organization and to opt-in to their program. In each such instance, you will know what data
            we collect through the Site, because you actively submit it. We are not responsible for emails you receive
            from a partner organization or third party that has independently obtained your email (i.e., when Parallel
            does not provide your email to the third party), even if the email is a third party email promoting
            Parallel’s goods or services.</p>

        <p><strong>Information we automatically collect. </strong> As part of the standard operation of the Site, we may
            collect information from your computer or mobile device, including but not limited to your browser type,
            operating system, IP address and the domain name from which you accessed the site, and if you are accessing
            our site with your mobile device, type of mobile device. In addition, we may collect information about how
            you use our Site, such as the date and time you visit the Site, the areas or pages of the Site that you
            visit, the amount of time you spend viewing the Site, the number of times you return to the Site and other
            click-stream data.</p>

        <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect the information
            described above. A cookie
            is a small text file that may be stored on the hard drive of your computer or device when you access the
            site. We may also use cookies to: (1) provide you with customized content or offers on the site; (2) monitor
            site usage; (3) remember you when you return to the site; and (4) conduct research to improve our content
            and services. We may also allow third parties such as web analytics partners, advertisers, marketers,
            shippers, product logisticians, customer service personnel, advocacy and outreach personnel, or ad networks
            to set or access their cookies or web beacons (also referred to as 1×1 pixel.gifs or action tags) on the
            site. For example, we may use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the
            Internet or to display ads for other companies on our site. These third-party advertising companies employ
            cookies and web beacons to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients, including us. To
            do so, these companies may use information about your visits to our site and other websites. This
            information may include: date/time of banner ad shown, their cookie, and the first three octets of the IP
            address. This anonymous information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. These third
            parties may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide ads about goods
            and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your
            choices about not having this information used, click here. You are free to decline cookies, but by doing
            so, you may not be able to use certain features on the site or take full advantage of all our offerings.

        <p><strong>3. Personal Data</strong></p>
        <p>We collect personal data for the following general purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To respond to the request that you sent us such as your request for information, or your request to
                subscribe to a service or purchase a product;
            </li>
            <li>
                To administer and respond to an application for employment that you sent us;
            </li>
            <li>
                To administer, protect and improve our Site and our systems;
            </li>
            <li>
                To better understand the preferences of our Site visitors;
            </li>
            <li>
                To identify server problems;
            </li>
            <li>
                To compile aggregated statistics about Site usage;
            </li>
            <li>
                To help personalize your experience of our Site;
            </li>
            <li>
                To improve our products and services and other internal business purposes;
            </li>
            <li>
                To provide you with information about our technologies, product or service releases, news, and other
                communications;
            </li>
            <li>
                To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may combine the various types of data that we collect,
                and;
            </li>
            <li>
                Any other use we describe at the point where we collect the data or prompt you to provide it.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We may also use or disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that
            such action is necessary to: (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the
            Site; (b) protect and defend our rights, property, the Site or our users; and (c) act under emergency
            circumstances to protect the personal safety of Parallel, our affiliates, agents, Site users, or the public.
        </p>

        <p>Parallel does not sell your personal information outside of our organization without your explicit
            permission. However, if you become a registered Site user, some information on our membership lists, such as
            your name and mailing address, may be exchanged with other organizations. Members may opt out of such
            membership list exchanges by following the opt-out procedures described below. If you submit an application
            for employment through our careers page hosted by a third party, your data will be provided directly to such
            third party provider and Parallel will also share your information with other organizations necessary to
            perform the purpose for which you provided the data, namely, to verify employment and education history,
            perform background checks, and perform other necessary functions related to reviewing and responding to an
            application for employment.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Opting Out</strong></p>

        <p>If you no longer wish to receive communications from Parallel, you may email us at info@parallelwireless.com
            or click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email sent to you by Parallel. You should know that
            opting out or unsubscribing from our site does not delete your personal information from our system, which
            may exist in backup or disaster-recovery files. Even if you opt out, we may continue to contact you via
            email for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding the
            administration of your account, renewal of your membership, updates regarding the status of your application
            for employment, contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Security</strong></p>
        <p>Parallel uses industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies in an attempt to ensure the
            secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information. While we try our best to safeguard your
            personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public
            network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

        <p><strong>6. IP Addresses</strong></p>

        <p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your
            Internet service provider whenever you access the Internet. This number may be the same each time you access
            the Internet, or it may change. Like other Internet sites, Parallel uses IP addresses to collect aggregate
            information about numbers of visitors and Site usage. The address is logged on our server when your computer
            requests information from Parallel. Parallel reserves the right, in rare instances, to use IP addresses to
            identify individuals who threaten our site, service, or users.</p>

        <p><strong>7. EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”)F</strong></p>

        <p>Parallel Wireless, Inc. is headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire, United States with offices in India,
            Israel, and the United Kingdom. Where required, Parallel Wireless complies with the GDPR and other
            applicable data protection laws.</p>

        <p><strong>How we use personal data</strong></p>

        <p>In addition to Section 3 above, Parallel will use your personal data based on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Our legitimate business interests: For example, when you provide your information to us in connection
                with marketing offers or solutions feedback. You may have the right to object to this use of your
                personal data. Please review the “Opting Out” and “Data Subject Rights” sections for more information.
            </li>
            <li>
                Contract: For example, we may process personal information of business contacts to establish a contract
                for goods or services between you and Parallel, maintain contact points, and send you invoices for
                ordered goods or services.
            </li>
            <li>
                Legal obligation: For example, when it is reasonably necessary for Parallel to retain your personal data
                to comply with a legal obligation on Parallel, such as tax laws, export control compliance, or to
                exercise or defend our legal rights.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consent: We will rely on your consent to retain and use your personal data if no other basis is
                relevant. You may have the right to object or withdraw your consent. Please review the “Opting Out” and
                “Data Subject Rights” sections for more information.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Data Transfers</strong></p>

        <p>To provide our products and services, including employment services, Parallel may transfer data across
            Parallel’s affiliate companies in different geographic locations. When we transfer personal data from the
            E.U. to the U.S., we do so in compliance with appropriate safeguards, such as signing E.U. Standard
            Contractual Clauses.</p>

        <p>Your local law may provide you with rights regarding the distribution and use of your personal data. For
            example, GDPR gives residents of the EU rights that they can exercise free of charge, including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Right to correct your personal information
            </li>
            <li>
                Right to withdraw consent
            </li>
            <li>
                Right to access your personal data
            </li>
            <li>
                Right to data portability
            </li>
            <li>
                Right to data deletion
            </li>
            <li>
                Right to object to processing
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>8. Notice to California Residents</strong></p>

        <p>Except with regard to the alternative detailed below, residents of the State of California have the right to
            request a list of all third parties to which a company conducting business in California has disclosed
            personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law
            provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of
            your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with
            information on how to exercise this choice.</p>

        <p>Parallel qualifies for this alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy policy and provide you with
            details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for
            direct marketing purposes. We are not required, therefore, to maintain or disclose a list of the third
            parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>

        <p><strong>9. Children’s Privacy</strong></p>

        <p>The Site is intended for adults. We do not intentionally or knowingly collect personally identifiable
            information from children under the age of 13. We request that children under the age of 13 not submit any
            information on the Site.</p>

        <p><strong>10. Other Websites</strong></p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only as long as you remain on the Site. Once you leave the Site, we have no
            control over your privacy or security issues even if you reached the other site by clicking on a link within
            the Site.</p>

        <p><strong>12. Amendments</strong></p>

        <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time and in our sole discretion. We reserve
            the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time, but will alert you
            that changes have been made by indicating on the Privacy Policy the date it was last updated. . We recommend
